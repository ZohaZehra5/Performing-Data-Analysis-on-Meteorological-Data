# Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data

The null hypothesis carried here is, "Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming"


We will be analyzing through this meteorological data set that the apparent temperature and humidity has increased or not in the same period for the past 10 years.


Note: Python 3.7 is required to run this project.
